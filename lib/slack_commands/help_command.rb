`bub`: the staging box tracking tool.

`bub info` â€“ list all known staging boxes, along with who has them claimed and when that box has last visited (according to the server logs).

`bub take sassy 3 hours deploy kk_some_branch` - claim the staging box named joyable-sassy for the next 3 hours and deploy the branch `kk_some_branch` to it.  Each section is optional:
  - If you omit the server, you'll get the first available server.
  - If you omit the time, you'll get a 1-hour claim.
  - If you omit the "deploy + branch", the branch won't be auto-deployed.

`bub release sassy` - releases your claim on joyable-sassy.  Omit the box name to release your claim on any box currently claimed by you.

`bub deploy production` - reserves a deploy lock for deploying to production. Will automatically expire after 5 minutes or a deploy has completed.

`bub help` - prints this message
